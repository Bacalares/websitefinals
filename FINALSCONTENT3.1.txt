<h2><FONT COLOR=“#21618C”>1. Intramuros, Manila</FONT></h2>
<IMG SRC="history1.jpg" width="700"height="400">
<p>Today's Intramuros is a historically significant area completely encircled by walls that was once thought to constitute the entirety of Manila during the Spanish Empire. The term "extramuros," which is Latin for "outside the walls," was used to describe other towns and arrabales (suburbs) that were beyond the city's walls and are now districts of Manila. These towns were autonomous settlements that weren't included in Manila until the early 20th century. From the colony's establishment in 1571 until 1865, Intramuros served as its capital, hosting both the Real Audiencia of Manila until the end of Spanish sovereignty during the Philippine Revolution of 1898, and the Captaincy General of the Philippines, a component realm of the Spanish Empire.

<h2><FONT COLOR=“#000080”>2. Rizal Park, Manila</FONT></h2>
<IMG SRC="history2.jpg" width="700"height="400">
<p>Even though Manila may welcome you with skyscrapers, enormous stores, and terrible traffic, make time to visit Rizal Park, one of the country's most recognizable attractions. One of Manila's most historic locations is this sizable urban park with a dancing fountain and a 60-hectare size, complete with well-kept plants.


<br><br>The Rizal Monument, which marks the location of Dr. Jose P. Rizal's execution, is located in what is more popularly referred to as Luneta Park.</p><hr><br>

<h2><FONT COLOR=“#000080”>3. Corregidor Island</FONT></h2>
<IMG SRC="history3.jpg" width="700"height="400">
<p>Corregidor Island, regarded as one of the Philippines' final military strongholds and a significant landmark in the country, is only a few hours from Manila. Corregidor was reinforced with coastal artillery during the American occupation to protect the entrance of Manila Bay from invading ships.


<br><br>Visits to locations including Battery Way, Battery Hearn, and the Pacific War Memorial, which was erected in commemoration of all the Filipino and American soldiers who fought during World War II, are all included in a day trip of Corregidor.</p><hr><br>

<h2><FONT COLOR=“#000080”>4. Calle Crisologo, Vigan</FONT></h2>
<IMG SRC="history4.jpg" width="700"height="400">
<p>The streets of Calle Crisologo in Vigan were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are thought to be one of the best examples of a Spanish colonial town that has survived in Asia.


<br><br>Experience a step back in time as you meander through quaint neighborhoods, marvel at Spanish colonial architecture, and savor delicious cuisine like the renowned Ilocos Empanada.</p><hr><br>

<h2><FONT COLOR=“#000080”>5. Fort Santiago, Manila</FONT></h2>
<IMG SRC="history5.jpg" width="700"height="400">
<p>Fort Santiago is located within Manila's Intramuros, a city surrounded by walls. When the Spaniards ruled the nation, it was once a stronghold that functioned as the headquarters for soldiers and foreign powers.

<br><br>Despite its ponds and fountains, it is most well-known for having been the location of national hero Jose Rizal's captivity just before his execution in what is now the Rizal Monument in Rizal Park.</p>
